Captcha in order to see mail
============================

At the bottom of TheMailTemplate, there is a capatcha that the user must fill
in order for him to see my e-mail address.

Description
-----------
This capatcha is shown at the bottom of the site, with a short description for
the user to understand.

The challenge itself is simple. The website choose three letters from my first
name, give their positions in my name to the user who must then input them in
the system.

If the user is right, the form is replaced by the e-mail address.

If he failed, an error message is shown and he can try again.

Model

My first name and e-mail address are stored in the website.
